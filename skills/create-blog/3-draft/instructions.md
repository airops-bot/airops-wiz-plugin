# Draft

Write the full article for **{topic}** based on the approved outline. Apply brand voice from the start.

## Writing requirements

- Follow the outline structure exactly
- Target **{word_count}** words (or playbook default)
- 8th grade reading level
- 2–3 sentence paragraphs max
- Define terms when introduced
- No unverified statistics or claims
- No filler phrases or fluff

## Article format

- **H1**: Title
- Short introduction (1–2 sentences; no rhetorical questions)
- **H2** sections with content following outline notes
- Use **Key point:** explanation where it helps readability
- **FAQ**: question as H3, answer as a short standalone paragraph (not "Yes" or "See above")

## After drafting

- Verify all outline sections are addressed
- Remove repetition
- Check brand voice consistency
- Add internal link suggestions where natural

**This step must be executed by the content-writer subagent** so brand voice is loaded in a fresh context. Use the seo-guidelines skill. Output the requested artifact (e.g. draft.html or draft.md).

**Save to:** draft.html
