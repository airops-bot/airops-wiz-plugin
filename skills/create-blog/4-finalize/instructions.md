# Finalize

Review and produce the final deliverable.

## Final checks

- Article meets word count
- Headers follow style guidelines
- No walls of text
- FAQ answers are standalone (full context, not "Yes, it is effective")

## Deliverable

Produce the final version with:

- Full article (markdown or HTML as required)
- Title tag (50–60 chars)
- Meta description (150–160 chars)
- Recommended slug

**Validation:** Run the content-critic subagent on this output. At most two fix iterations (see run context).

**Save to:** final.html
