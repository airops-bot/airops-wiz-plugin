# Outline

Create a detailed outline for **{topic}** targeting **{audience}**. Reference brand context for tone and positioning.

## Outline format

- **H1**: Article title
- **H2** sections with notes on what to cover in each
- **H3** for subsections where needed
- **FAQ** section with questions and brief answer guidance

## Header rules

- Sentence case (first word capitalized, rest lowercase except proper nouns)
- No colons or em-dashes in headers
- Use questions where natural ("What is X" not "Definition of X")
- Maximum 5–6 H2 sections (excluding FAQ)
- H3s only for lists, steps, or subtopics

## Section notes

Each section should have brief notes: what question it answers for the reader, key points or examples to include, any formatting (bullets, tables).

Target length: **{word_count}** words (or the playbook's word_count input).

**Checkpoint:** If the playbook requests it, pause for outline review before drafting.
