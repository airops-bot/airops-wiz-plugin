# Refresh plan

Based on audit, freshness check, and competitive check, create the refresh plan.

## Plan by depth

- **Quick:** Focus on updating stats and fixing broken links
- **Standard:** Update stats, add missing info, improve weak sections
- **Deep:** Consider structural changes, major additions, potential rewrite

## Plan format

For each section or element: Keep as-is, Update, Remove, Add, or Structural change.

**Checkpoint:** If requested, pause for plan review before executing.

Save the plan (e.g. refresh-plan.md).

**Save to:** refresh-plan.md
