# Execute

Apply the approved refresh plan to the content at **{source}**.

## Process

- Delegate to content-writer for prose changes where voice matters
- Replace outdated statistics; fix or replace broken links; add new sections; remove outdated content

## Quality checks

- Old and new content blend naturally; no jarring transitions
- Brand voice consistent; all new claims verified

**This step must be executed by the content-writer subagent** for any substantial prose. Output the refreshed draft.

**Save to:** draft.html (or refreshed draft path)
