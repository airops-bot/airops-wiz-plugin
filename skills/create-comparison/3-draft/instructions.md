## Requirements

- Follow outline structure; use specific facts and cite sources
- Use comparison tables for head-to-head sections
- Tone: expert and opinionated but fair; acknowledge strengths; recommend competitor when genuinely better; be transparent if we have a stake
- Verify pricing current; fact-check feature claims; ensure both get fair treatment

**This step must be executed by the content-writer subagent.** Use the seo-guidelines skill. Output the requested artifact.
