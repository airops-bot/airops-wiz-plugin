# Outline (comparison)

Create the comparison framework for **{subject_a}** vs **{subject_b}** for **{audience}**. Reference brand context.

## Outline format

- **H1**: {subject_a} vs {subject_b} with benefit for audience
- **H2**: Quick verdict — TL;DR for audience, who should choose what
- **H2**: What is {subject_a}? / What is {subject_b}?
- **H2**: 4–6 comparison dimensions (features, ease of use, pricing, integrations, support, etc.)
- **H2**: Pricing comparison
- **H2**: Which should you choose? (nuanced recommendation)
- **FAQ**

Apply **bias** if specified: neutral (balanced), favor_a, or favor_b — while being fair.

Target **{word_count}** words. **Checkpoint:** If requested, pause for outline review before drafting.
